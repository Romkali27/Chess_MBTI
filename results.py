  'UHNL': 'You are the Rebel — unconventional, creative, and dangerously accurate. \nYou reject bookish routes and look for rich, tricky positions that confuse and frustrate. \nYou know your ideas are sound enough — and your concrete skills back them up. \nYou do not follow the meta — you redefine it.',
  'UHNV': 'The Gunslinger walks into chaos with confidence. \nYou do not just tolerate sharp, wild positions — you manufacture them, calculating your way through the madness. \nYour play is sharp, surprising, and unorthodox — and your opponents rarely see what is coming. \nYou are here to fight, not follow.',
