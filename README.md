# Welcome to *Chess MBTI* project on **GitHub**!
## The creative basis of this project is Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI for short.
## MBTI is a personality test with 16 possible outcomes in form of 4-letter types.
## Chess MBTI uses the same type system which was modified to better fit different chess playing style traits.
## This version of Chess MBTI is the first version that uses player's game statistics rather than being test-based.
## The main purpose of this project is to increase social interaction between chess players online, but also to provide valuable insights to players worldwide.
## Overall, I sincerely hope that each user will enjoy using this project and find it interesting! :)
